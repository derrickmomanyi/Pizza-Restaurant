### Pizza Restaurant

## Introduction
For this assessment, you'll be working on an API for tracking pizzas restaurants.



## Requirements
For this project, you must:

## Create a Rails API backend.
Have at least three resources (three DB tables).
 

 ## Technologies Used

- Ruby on Rails
- AMG - Active Model Serializer
- SQLite3

## Project Setup
Once you have the plan in place for the application you want to build take the following steps:

Create a new Rails project.
Create a new GitHub repository (NB: ENSURE IT IS PRIVATE).
Add your TM as a contributor to the project. (This is only for grading purposes. We promise, we won't steal your code)
Ensure you regularly commit to the repository.
Project Guidelines
Your project should conform to the following set of guidelines:

 Models
You need to create the following relationships:

- A `Restaurant` has many `Pizza`s through `RestaurantPizza`
- A `Pizza` has many `Restaurant`s through `RestaurantPizza`
- A `RestaurantPizza` belongs to a `Restaurant` and belongs to a `Pizza`

Start by creating the models and migrations for the following database tables:

Add any code needed in the model files to establish the relationships. Then, run the migrations.

 You are welcome to generate your own seed data to test the application.

Validations
Add validations to the `RestaurantPizza` model:

- must have a `price` between 1 and 30

Routes
Set up the following routes. Make sure to return JSON data in the format
specified along with the appropriate HTTP verb.

GET /restaurants
Return JSON data in the format below:

```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Sottocasa NYC",
    "address": "298 Atlantic Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11201"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "PizzArte",
    "address": "69 W 55th St, New York, NY 10019"
  }
]
```

GET /restaurants/:id
If the `Restaurant` exists, return JSON data in the format below:

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Sottocasa NYC",
  "address": "298 Atlantic Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11201",
  "pizzas": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Cheese",
      "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Pepperoni",
      "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese, Pepperoni"
    }
  ]
}
```

If the `Restaurant` does not exist, return the following JSON data, along with
the appropriate HTTP status code:

```
{
  "error": "Restaurant not found"
}
```

DELETE /restaurants/:id
If the `Restaurant` exists, it should be removed from the database, along with
any `RestaurantPizza`s that are associated with it (a `RestaurantPizza` belongs
to a `Restaurant`, so you need to delete the `RestaurantPizza`s before the
`Restaurant` can be deleted).

After deleting the `Restaurant`, return an _empty_ response body, along with the
appropriate HTTP status code.

If the `Restaurant` does not exist, return the following JSON data, along with
the appropriate HTTP status code:

```
{
  "error": "Restaurant not found"
}
```

GET /pizzas
Return JSON data in the format below:

```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Cheese",
    "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Pepperoni",
    "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese, Pepperoni"
  }
]
```

POST /restaurant_pizzas
This route should create a new `RestaurantPizza` that is associated with an
existing `Pizza` and `Restaurant`. It should accept an object with the following
properties in the body of the request:

```
{
  "price": 5,
  "pizza_id": 1,
  "restaurant_id": 3
}
```

If the `RestaurantPizza` is created successfully, send back a response with the data
related to the `Pizza`:

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Cheese",
  "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese"
}
```

If the `RestaurantPizza` is **not** created successfully, return the following
JSON data, along with the appropriate HTTP status code:

```
{
  "errors": ["validation errors"]
}

```
